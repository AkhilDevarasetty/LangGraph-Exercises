# LangGraph Exercises

A hands-on learning project to master **LangGraph** and **Agentic Workflows** from scratch.

## 📚 About This Project

This repository documents my journey learning LangGraph and building agentic workflows. Each exercise and notebook represents practical, hands-on experience with creating AI agents and orchestrating complex workflows.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understanding LangGraph fundamentals
- Building and orchestrating AI agents
- Implementing agentic workflows
- Exploring state management in agent systems
- Creating practical applications with LangGraph

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda for package management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkhilDevarasetty/LangGraph-Exercises.git
cd LangGraph-Exercises
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If requirements.txt exists
```

4. Set up your environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env  # If example exists
# Edit .env with your API keys
```
